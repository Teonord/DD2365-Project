Run using local installation of Jupyter Notebook with FEniCS. Colab will not work due to the saving of plot images.

To change flap angle, change the "angle" variable. Negative angles will automatically flip the wing in the y-direction.

To test with leading-edge flap, set "mirror_x" to True.

To test ground effect, change "Hpos" variable. Remember that the origin point for the wing polygon is 0.1 units above the middle of the wing.
